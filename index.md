# About

> **Service update:** *The {{site.data.keyword.personalityinsightsshort}} service was updated on April 10, 2017, to reduce the amount of input content that it uses for large requests. The service produces a profile with the same level of accuracy, but it returns its response much more quickly. For more information about all recent updates to the service, see the [Release notes](/docs/services/personality-insights/release-notes.html).*

The {{site.data.keyword.personalityinsightsfull}} service provides an Application Programming Interface (API) that enables applications to derive insights from social media, enterprise data, or other digital communications. The service uses linguistic analytics to infer individuals' intrinsic personality characteristics, including Big Five, Needs, and Values, from digital communications such as email, text messages, tweets, and forum posts.

The service can automatically infer, from potentially noisy social media, portraits of individuals that reflect their personality characteristics. It can also determine individuals' consumption preferences, which indicate their likelihood to prefer various products, services, and activities.
